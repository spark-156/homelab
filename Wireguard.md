# Wireguard
I use wireguard because its lightweight, new, up and coming and most above all; very promising.

## Install
I installed it natively following this guide:
https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-set-up-wireguard-vpn-on-ubuntu-20-04/

I thought about running it inside of docker but decided against it as it will run as ubuntu natively supports it.
